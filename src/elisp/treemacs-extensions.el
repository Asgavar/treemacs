  "Macro that produces the strings required to render a single treemacs node.
To be used as a `:render-action' for `treemacs-define-expandable-node'.

ICON is a simple string serving as the node's icon, and must be created with
`treemacs-as-icon'.

LABEL-FORM must return the string that will servce as the node's label text,
based on the element that should be rendered being bound as `item'. So for
example if rendering a list of buffers RENDER-FORM would look like
`(buffer-name item)'.

STATE is the symbol that will identify the type of the node.

FACE is its face.

KEY-FORM is the form to will give the node a unique key, necessary for
compatiblity and integration with follow-mode and filewatch-mode.

MORE-PROPERTIES is a plist that can arbitrarily appended for quick retrieval
later."

QUERY-FUNCTION is a form and will be invoked when the node is expanded. It must
provide the list of elements that will be rendered with RENDER-ACTION.

RENDER-ACTION is another form that will render the single items provided by
QUERY-FUNCTION. For every RENDER-FORM invocation the element to be rendered is
bound under the name `item'. The form itself should end in a call to
`treemacs-render-node'.

ROOT is a special form, only needed for the definition of top-level nodes. It is
a list of 3 elements: the root node's label, its face and its key-form. This
special provision is necessary for root nodes, as they are not rendered by means
of another extension function calling `treemacs-render-node'."
